# About Me

I'm a motivated transitioning service member, currently enrolled in the Washington Vets to Tech (WAV2T) program. This four-month certificate program will result in eighteen college credit hours towards a bachelor’s degree in computer science. Topics studied include Python, C#, HTML, Asp.Net, SQL, Fundamentals of Databases, Data Structures & Algorithms, and AI-Assisted Analysis and Development.

As I prepare to transition into the tech industry, I’m excited to combine my extensive logistics and operations experience with cutting-edge technology. My journey has sparked a passion for problem-solving and innovation, and I’m eager to apply my project management and team leadership skills in a tech environment. I believe technology can drive efficiency and collaboration, and I’m committed to continuous learning to stay ahead in this dynamic field.

I value authentic connections and aim to empower teams to reach their full potential. Throughout my career, I’ve developed strong management skills by leading diverse teams in various environments. Whether coordinating logistics support or mentoring others, I thrive in roles that require strategic thinking.

As I prepare to leave the military in December 2024, I’m eager to explore new opportunities and am open to relocation. While I bring a wealth of experience, I’m also excited to learn and adapt to new challenges in the tech industry, actively pursuing a degree and certifications in Computer Science.

When I’m not working, you can find me strategizing over Monopoly, playing video games, mentoring, networking over coffee, hiking, building puzzles, or studying. 

Oh, and I love football! Let's connect, and let's talk about how I can be the "Tom Brady" for your company!
